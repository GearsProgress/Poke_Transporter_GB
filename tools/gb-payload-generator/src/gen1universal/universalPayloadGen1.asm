	db PIDGEOTTO ; On JP, the diacritics on the 1st and 2nd characters of this species name (ピジョン) will overwrite the stack, leading to a return to 0xE5E4.

	db 0xE4 ; Blank on RB, places C9 FE 81 20 15 FA 71 C9 FE 00 at 0xD9AA, the latter 6 characters are then reinterpreted as species IDs. This causes EN Yellow to get stuck printing 0xC9's name, while ensuring the stack smash species ID remains intact. WHen the player presses A twice on this state, the game will execute code starting from  (due to the placement of 0xFE's species name intercepting the expected jump towards 0xFA0E).

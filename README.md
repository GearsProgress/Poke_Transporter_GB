## About
Poké Transporter GB is a transfer tool for created to transfer Pokémon from Pokémon Red and Blue to Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald. Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal are currently in development as well and will be added in the near future. Poké Transporter GB is designed to emulate what GameFreak may have released should they persued it. Many inspirations were taken from the Pal Park, PokéTransfer Lab, and PokéTransporter to keep a "GameFreak" feeling.

_Poké Transporter GB WILL modify both your generation 3 and generation 1/2 save file. The program is designed to not corrupt anything, but if you do not wish to modify your save file then you should bypass this experience._

_**Please note that Poké Transporter GB is still in beta, so save file backups of both games are HIGHLY recommended before using**._

## Notes
Pokémon Transfered using Poké Transporter GB *will* be removed from Green, Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold Silver, or Crystal.

Currently the only release is in English. Releases supporting other languages is planned for the near future.

Only English copies of Red, Blue, Ruby, Sappire, FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald are supported at this time. Compatibility for other languages, as well as Green, Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal, will be added in the near future.

## Usage
Poké Transporter GB is a Multiboot program for the Game Boy Advance. There are two main ways to run the Poké Transporter GB ROM on a Game Boy Advance:
- Use a program such as FIX94's [GBA Link Cable ROM Sender](https://github.com/FIX94/gba-link-cable-rom-sender) on a GameCube or Wii running Homebrew along with a GBA GameCube Link Cable
- Upload the Multiboot ROM to a GBA Flash Cart, launch the game in Multiboot mode (often by holding L when selecting the ROM), and swap the Game Pak after the program loads.

Please note that transfering Pokémon will only work with a Game Boy Color Link Cable. Game Boy Advance Link Cables will not work.

## Modifications to Transfered Pokémon

Due to limitations of the transfer process, some Pokémon will not be considered legal until they reach certain generations:

|Pokémon|Generation III|Generation IV|Generation V|Passes through Pokémon Bank|Generation VI|Generation VII+|Passes through Pokémon HOME|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Standard Pokémon from Generation I|No<br>(Illegal Met Location)|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Standard Pokémon from Generation II|No<br>(Illegal Met Location, Illegal Game of Origin)|No<br>(Illegal Encounter type)|No<br>(Illegal Encounter type)|Yes|No<br>(Illegal Encounter type)|Yes|Yes|
|Legendary Pokémon from Generation I|No<br>(Illegal Met Location)|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Legendary Pokémon from Generation II|No<br>(Illegal Met Location, Illegal Game of Origin)|No<br>(Illegal Encounter type)|No<br>(Illegal Encounter type)|Yes|No<br>(Illegal Encounter type)|Yes|Yes|
|Mew from Generation I/II|No<br>(Does not match event)|No<br>(Does not match event)|No<br>(Does not match event)|?<br>(? if Shiny)|No<br>(Does not match event)|No<br>(Does not match event)|?|
|Celebi from Generation II|No<br>(Does not match event)|No<br>(Does not match event)|No<br>(Does not match event)|?<br>(? if Shiny)|No<br>(Does not match event)|No<br>(Does not match event)|?|
|Stabilized Mew|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|Stabilized Celebi|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|

Due to Mew and Celebi being illegal, an option is given to the player to "stabilize" them. This will convert the Pokémon into a legal event version of the mythical Pokémon. This event will be randomly generated and will not copy any of the data from generation 1/2- ***including shininess***. The mythical Pokémon will still be removed from the generation 1/2 game.

## Why?
One of my favorite aspects of the Pokémon franchise is the ability to send Pokémon forward into the most recent generation. Of course, this isn't possible from the Gameboy games into the Gameboy Advance era- and I wanted to fix that. A handful of Poeople have bridged the gap before, but Poké Transporter GB is the first tool designed to transfer Pokémon like the Pal Park, PokéTransport Lab, and PokéTransporter for Generation 1 and 2 to Generation 3. Documentation detailing the design process of Poké Transporter GB can be found [here](https://www.austinthomasweber.com/poke-transporter-gb)!

## Special Mentions
A huge thank you to Goppier for being the first one to bridge the gap between generation 2 and generation 3 and for provide exremely useful documentation about both versions of the Link Cable, and a huge thank you to Lorenzooone for being the direct inspiration for this project, as well as answering questions I had during development. This project would never have happened without either of them, and I cannot thank them enough.

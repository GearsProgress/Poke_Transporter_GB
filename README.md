## About this repo

Pokemon Mirror is a transfer tool for transfering Pokemon from Generations One and Two into Generation Three.

Emphasis is being put on making a program that is as easy to use and stays as accurate as possible to what a true Generation One and Two transfer tool made by the Pokemon Developers would be.

### Why?

One of my favorite aspects of the Pokemon franchise is the ability to send Pokemon forward into the most recent generation. Of course, this isn't possible from the Gameboy games into the Gameboy Advance era- and I want to fix that. Other people have created tools, but my goal is to make one that is the most accurate and least "homebrew-y"

## About
Pokemon Mirror is a transfer tool for created to transfer Pokemon from Pokemon Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, and Crystal to Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald. Pokemon Mirror is designed to emulate what GameFreak may have released should they persued it. Many inspirations were taken from the Pal Park, PokeTransfer Lab, and PokeTransporte to keep a "GameFreak" feeling.

_**Pokemon Transfered using Pokemon Mirror will *not* be removed from Green, Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold Silver, or Crystal. This is not only to save on time when transfering, but also to guarentee that Pokemon are not lost and are able to be transfered again if a large update is made to the program.**_

*Currently the only release is in English. Releases supporting other languages is planned for the near future.*
*Only English copies of Ruby, Sappire, FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald are supported at this time. However, all languages of Green, Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold Silver, and Crystal are supported! Compatibility for other languages will be added in the near future.*

## Modifications to Transfered Pokemon
A list of modifications made to transfered Pokemon can be found [here](https://github.com/Starport75/Pokemon_Mirror/blob/master/Pokemon_Modifications.md)!

## Why?
One of my favorite aspects of the Pokemon franchise is the ability to send Pokemon forward into the most recent generation. Of course, this isn't possible from the Gameboy games into the Gameboy Advance era- and I wanted to fix that. A handful of Poeople have bridged the gap before, but Pokemon Mirror is the first tool designed to transfer Pokemon like the Pal Park, PokeTransport Lab, and PokeTransporter for Generation 1 and 2 to Generation 3.
